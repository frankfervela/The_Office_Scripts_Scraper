# The_Office_Scripts_Scraper
Scraper for all office scripts

This scraper made possible the begining of an "ambitious" project my friends and I thought and joked around.
Finding the scripts for The Office was crucial to fullfill the first requirement. No website out there was found that would offer the pdfs or text files with the lines but there were some that had the scripts embedded in their html.
Thanks to those fans for that.

## How it Works
This scraper will connect to the given url and will capture all the links containing each episode, then go to each episode's lin and loops through
the html looking for the content of each line and who says it.

Then it will save all this content to a text file.
